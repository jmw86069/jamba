# Jamba Overview

Jamba is intended to contain JAM base functions, to be re-used during
analysis, and by other R packages. Functions are broadly divided into
categories.

## Plot functions

### plotSmoothScatter

A common problem when visualizing extremely large datasets is how to
display thousands of datapoints while indicating the amount of overlap
of those points. The R `graphics::smoothScatter()` function provides an
adequate drop-in replacement for most uses of `plot()`, but several aspects are
not easily customized and are targeted by the `jamba::plotSmoothScatter()`
function.

First, the `useRaster=TRUE` feature from `graphics::image()` is intended to
enable rasterized images instead of rendering multiple polygons. The
rasterized image saves substantial image space, is more efficiently saved
as vectorized output in PDF and SVG, and is more efficiently displayed
on a remote plot device. However it is not consistently honored, and
has some problem when the plot aspect ratio is not 1:1. The
`plotSmoothScatter` function consistently enforces `useRaster=TRUE` by
calling a custom `jamba::imageDefault()` function, which has methods to
handle non-square visualization.

A quick way to see some enhancements of plotSmoothScatter is by running
doTest=TRUE:

```{r plotSmoothScatter, fig.show='hold'}
plotSmoothScatter(doTest=TRUE);
```

The data represents a highly correlated x- and y-axis, with a secondary
"band" of correlation added slightly offset. Each row contains an increasing
amount of background noise.

The left column shows graphics::smoothScatter, using the same color ramp
used by plotSmoothScatter. The secondary "band" is somewhat obscured by the
default density function. The second and third columns show the effect
of using custom bandwidth in plotSmoothScatter.

Also, while smoothScatter displays 50 points on the extremes by default, in
order to show the range of data which may otherwise not be visible, the
bandwidth function in plotSmoothScatter typically displays the full extent
of the data without these additional points.

### imageByColors

The `imageByColors()` function is intended to take a matrix or data.frame
and create the equivalent of `image()`. It also displays cell labels when
supplied in an equivalent matrix or data.frame, by default combining adjacent
labels so only one label is displayed in the middle of a contiguous range
of cells.

This function is particularly useful
when displaying something like experiment design,
where each factor level in the experiment has been assigned a color.

Here, we define a simple data.frame composed of colors, then use
the data.frame to label itself:

```{r imageByColors1, fig.show='hold'}
a1 <- c("red","blue")[c(1,1,2)];
b1 <- c("yellow","orange")[c(1,2,2)];
c1 <- c("purple","orange")[c(1,2,2)];
d1 <- c("purple","green")[c(1,2,2)];
df1 <- data.frame(a=a1, b=b1, c=c1, d=d1);
imageByColors(df1, cellnote=df1);
```

The `imageByColors()` function calls `imageDefault()` which obeys the
`useRaster=TRUE` directive. It attempts to correct for blurriness in the
output, with the benefit of efficiency in rendering.

Lastly, the labels can be rotated and resized, to allow flexibility
in positioning labels as needed in the final plot. Below we render a
rasterized image, showing text rotated and adjusted in various ways.

```{r imageByColors2, fig.show='hold'}
imageByColors(df1, cellnote=df1, useRaster=TRUE, adjBy="column",
   cexCellnote=list(c(1.5,1.5,1), c(1,1.5), c(1.6,1.2), c(1.6,1.5)),
   srtCellnote=list(c(90,0,0), c(0,45), c(0,0,0), c(0,90,0)));
```


## Helper functions

### mixedSort and mixedOrder

The `gtools` package implemented a function mixedsort() which aimed to mixedSort
vectors similar GNU version sort, where numeric values within an alphanumeric
string would be sorted in proper numerical order.

The mixedSort() function is an optimization and extension, driven by the
desire to sort tens of thousands of gene symbols (and micro-RNAs, miRNA)
efficiently and based upon known order. Also, because miRNA nomenclature
includes a dash '-' character, numbers are no longer allowed to be negative
during this sorting algorithm, unless overridden.
For example "miR-2" should sort before "miR-11", and after "miR-1".

```{r mixedSort, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
if (suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(gtools))) {
    x <- c("miR-12","miR-1","miR-122","miR-1b", "miR-1a", "miR-2");
    df <- data.frame(sort=sort(x),
        gtools_mixedsort=gtools::mixedsort(x),
        mixedSort=mixedSort(x));
} else {
    x <- c("miR-12","miR-1","miR-122","miR-1b", "miR-1a", "miR-2");
    df <- data.frame(sort=sort(x),
        mixedSort=mixedSort(x));
}
knitr::kable(df);
```

Note: it took roughly 12 seconds to sort 43,000 gene symbols using
gtools::mixedsort, and roughly 0.5 seconds using mixedSort.

The mixedOrder() function is actually the core ordering algorithm,
called by mixedSort(). The mixedOrder() function does not fully behave
like order(), in that order() accepts a list of vectors as one type of input,
and applies the order logic to each list iteratively, in order break ties.
Instead the mmixedOrder() function was implemented to serve that purpose.

### mixedSortDF

The mixedSortDF() function is a convenient wrapper around mixedSort()
applied to data.frames. It sorts columns in a specified order, maintaining
ties in each column, and breaking ties as warranted in subsequent columns.
It has the added benefit of maintaining factor order, so a data.frame
that contains a column of factors with a specified order will maintain that
order during the sort process. This behavior is especially useful when
sorting a data.frame with experiment design, where each column may contain
an ordered factor indicating the proper sample group ordering.

```{r mixedSortDF1, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
x <- c("miR-12","miR-1","miR-122","miR-1b", "miR-1a","miR-2");
g <- rep(c("Air", "Treatment", "Control"), 2);
gf <- factor(g, levels=c("Control","Air", "Treatment"));
df2 <- data.frame(groupfactor=gf, miRNA=x, stringsAsFactors=FALSE);
df2sorted <- mixedSortDF(df2);
```
```{r mixedSortDF2, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(df2sorted);
```


### setPrompt

When working with multiple R sessions, sometimes on different computers, it
can be helpful to add visual cues to help reinforce which R session is for
which project. The `setPrompt()` function is intended simply to update the
R console prompt to include the project name. It also adds the R version,
and optionally the process ID.

The process ID is particularly helpful if one R session becomes inactive,
and if there are other active R sessions open. The process ID can be a helpful
way to kill the specific R session without fear of accidentally killing the
wrong one.

`setPrompt()` will also define the prompt using terminal colors, if the
`crayon` package is installed, and if terminal colors are enabled.

```{r setPrompt, echo=TRUE}
setPrompt("jambaVignette");
# {jamba}-R-3.3.2_10789>
```

![setPrompt example](README-setPrompt.png)

When using the `jamsession` R package to manage R sessions, the prompt is
a helpful way to reinforce the name of the active R session, using the same
name to save the session.
